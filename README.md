- 👋 Hi, I’m @irlorion05
- 👀 I'm a Data Scientist at Magnite based out of Edinburgh, UK. I’m interested in data science, language evolution, comparative cognition, evolution of cognition, multi-agent systems, artificial language agents, the effects of social structure on language evolution, animal language, AI, deep learning, evolution, and biologically informed AI and ML. 
- 🌱 I’m learning to be a better data scientist overall. This means transitioning from just Jupyter notebooks to building more actual, deployable code as well as learning new techniques and studying foundational math and concepts. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to do with language evolution, animal cognition and language, or artificial agents.
