- 👋 Hi, I’m @irlorion05
- 👀 I’m interested in language evolution, comparative cognition, evolution of cognition, multi-agent systems, artificial language agents, the effects of social structure on language evolution, animal language, machine learning techniques, deep learning, ethical AI, biologically informed AI and ML.
